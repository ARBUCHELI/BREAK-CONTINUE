# BREAK-CONTINUE

Write a loop with a <strong>break</strong> statement to create a string, <strong>news_ticker</strong>, that is exactly 140 characters long.
You should create the news ticker by adding headlines from the <strong>headlines</strong> list, inserting a space in between each headline.
If necessary, truncate the last headline in the middle so that <strong>news_ticker</strong> is exactly 140 characters long.

Remember that <strong>break</strong> works in both <strong>for</strong> and <strong>while</strong> loops. Use whichever loop seems most
appropriate. Consider adding <strong>print</strong> statements to your code to help you resolve bugs.
